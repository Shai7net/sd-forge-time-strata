"""Generating a chain's frames with Deforum, set up for the shot.

The frames of a chain made from a video are the motion. They are laid on a flat backdrop and given to Deforum
as its Video Input and to ControlNet, so every frame it draws has the figure exactly where the motion chain has
it, on a backdrop whose colour is known. And:
- Deforum's own camera stands still (the 3D camera is Time Strata's). DeforumationQT is left out of these frames:
  it would move the camera and set the steps. Its switch is turned off in memory only for the job and put back
  when the job ends; its file is never written. (Its pan and rotation still steer the trail: see dqt.py.)
- The seed is fixed, so neighbouring frames, which stand a few centimetres apart in the chain, share their
  texture and the chain reads as one body.
- Scenes (as in Infinite Zoom): each starts at a second of the motion with its own prompt, and may fill the
  figure with its own texture and give it its own look picture; one scene blends into the next over `blend`
  seconds, its prompt by Deforum's composable weights ("a :0.7 AND b :0.3"), its texture and look by a crossfade.
- ControlNet units hold the drawing to the motion: the pose, the depth, the edges, the silhouette (QR Monster)
  and the look of a picture (IP-Adapter), each with its own weight and the part of the steps it acts in.
- While Deforum draws, every new frame is cut by the backdrop's colour and shown in the 3D view at once.
- The cut takes the backdrop away by its colour, keeps the motion figure's body solid and nothing far from it.
- Deforum writes into the chain's own folder, not into the usual outputs.
